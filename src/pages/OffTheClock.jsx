            Beyond the code, I'm a queer young adult who loves reading, writing, and storytelling. I'm also a cat person and a gamer. I'm someone who believes that our personal interests and experiences 
            deeply influence how we approach problems and create solutions. Here's a glimpse into 
            what drives me and how it connects to my development work.

            <p>
            I write queer fiction and romance — the kinds of stories I wish I'd had growing up. Telling those stories now has been healing in ways I didn’t expect, and wildly fun in the best ways. As an adult, discovering that the limit doesn’t exist when it comes to whose stories get told has opened up a whole new creative world.
            </p>
            <p>
            Reading and writing have both deeply shaped how I think, build, and create across disciplines. Whether I’m writing code, designing interfaces, or developing content, I always come back to storytelling — it’s at the heart of clarity, empathy, and good design.
            </p>

          <h2 className="section-title"><span className="emoji">🎮</span> The Sims & My Journey</h2>
          <p>
          Growing up, The Sims was more than just a game—it was a safe sandbox where I could explore, experiment, and create without judgment. 
          It gave me space to tell stories, test ideas, and build whole worlds on my own terms.
          </p>
          <p>
          Through The Sims, I naturally found my way into both storytelling and systems thinking—two things I’ve been consistently drawn back to as an adult. 
          Whether I'm designing user interfaces or writing interactive narratives, the lessons I learned in that sandbox still guide my creative and development work today.

          <h2 className="section-title"><span className="emoji">💡</span> Designing with Empathy</h2>
            <p>
            Before I ever touched a line of code, I worked in social services—supporting youth, navigating complex systems, and learning how to listen deeply. 
            I also grew up with a disabled sibling, and as a teenager, I wrestled with my own learning disabilities. These experiences shaped how I see the world—and how I build within it.
            </p>
            <p>
            They’re what drew me to psychology, to systems thinking, and eventually to accessible design and development. 
            I believe technology should meet people where they are—whether that means designing with empathy, simplifying complexity, 
            or making sure no one is left out of the experience. For me, development isn’t just technical—it’s personal.

          <p>
            I have two fur babies, and they're a constant reminder of the importance of patience, 
            observation, and understanding different perspectives. They also provide excellent 
            companionship during frustrating moments of debugging. Strongly recommend.
