            A socially-driven investment experience for a new generation, winner of the DesCan UX Hackathon at Emily Carr University. 
            Designed to make investing more approachable, Invest Together reimagines financial literacy as a team-based, seasonal game—blending 
            social accountability with real-world growth. Inspired by the mechanics of popular games like Fortnite, the app invites users to 
            build smart money habits while competing alongside (or against) their friends and family.

                We designed Invest Together to blend gamification, social motivation, and simplified investing into one accessible app. 
                By reducing financial barriers, encouraging teamwork, and giving users the tools to learn from each other, we created a 
                system where investing becomes less intimidating—and a lot more fun.
